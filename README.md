# LinuxStudio , The Linux Management Platform

##  Project Overview

LinuxStudio is a **web-based Linux management platform** designed to unify **Cockpit** and **Portainer** into one seamless experience. Managing Linux servers typically means juggling multiple tools, memorizing terminal commands, and SSHing into systems just to monitor basic metrics.

LinuxStudio eliminates this complexity by providing a **matrix-style green terminal aesthetic dashboard**, where systemd services, Docker containers, logs, and metrics can all be managed visually while still showing the equivalent commands behind the scenes.

This makes LinuxStudio not just a management tool, but also a **learning bridge for Linux users**, empowering them with transparency and confidence.

##  Key Features

* **Unified Dashboard** – Single platform for Linux and Docker management.
* **Command Preview Mode** – Displays equivalent Linux commands before execution.
* **Real-Time Updates** – WebSocket-powered live monitoring of metrics, services, and containers.
* **Mobile-First** – Responsive design for desktops, tablets, and phones.
* **Matrix Green Aesthetic** – Neon-green terminal-inspired UI with glowing highlights.
* **Secure by Design** – JWT authentication, session management, and best-practice coding standards.
* **Cross-Platform Support** – Works on Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS/RHEL, Fedora, and openSUSE.

##  Tech Stack

### **Frontend**

* **Next.js 14** (React + TypeScript, server-side rendering)
* **Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui** for sleek, accessible components
* **Zustand** for state management
* **React Query** for async data fetching
* **Chart.js** with neon-styled, real-time graphs
* **Socket.io (client)** for live data

### **Backend**

* **Node.js (Express, TypeScript)** for APIs
* **Socket.io (server)** for real-time updates
* **JWT** for authentication
* **Cockpit API integration** (systemd, logs, users)
* **Portainer API integration** (containers, volumes, images)
* **Docker SDK** for direct container interactions

### **Databases**

* **PostgreSQL** for persistent user data and settings
* **Redis** for fast session management
* **InfluxDB** for long-term metrics storage

##  System Requirements

* **Linux host:** Ubuntu 22.04/24.04 LTS recommended
* Works with: Debian 11/12, CentOS Stream 9, RHEL 9, Fedora 38+, openSUSE Leap 15.5+
* **Docker installed** and running
* **2GB RAM minimum**, 10GB free disk space

##  Development Roadmap

### Phase 1 – Foundation

* Setup project structure (frontend + backend + Docker configs).
* Establish Cockpit & Portainer API connectors.

### Phase 2 – Backend API

* Implement modular architecture (controllers, services, middleware).
* Add JWT authentication and secure endpoints.

### Phase 3 – Frontend UI

* Build dashboard with matrix green design.
* Add reusable UI components (services, containers, logs).

### Phase 4 – Integration

* Connect Cockpit/Portainer APIs with frontend.
* Implement real-time updates (Socket.io).

### Phase 5 – Advanced Features

* Command Preview Mode (learn-as-you-manage).
* Mobile optimization and offline support.

### Phase 6 – Production Readiness

* Testing, CI/CD pipelines, Docker deployment.
* Documentation and open-source contributions.

##  Contribution to Open Source

LinuxStudio is not just a tool—it’s a **community learning project** for the **open-source society**.

Here’s how it contributes:

* **Transparency & Learning:** Command Preview Mode helps beginners understand Linux commands behind GUI actions.
* **Collaboration-Friendly:** Modular, open-source architecture makes it easy for contributors to extend functionality.
* **Bridging Tools:** Combines Cockpit and Portainer, reducing fragmentation and aligning with open-source philosophy of interoperability.
* **Educational Value:** Perfect for students, sysadmins, and hobbyists to learn Linux, Docker, and serverless design patterns.
* **Future Extensions:** Encourages community-driven features like analytics dashboards, theme packs, and custom API plugins.

We invite contributions in the form of:

* UI/UX improvements (green terminal themes, accessibility enhancements)
* Backend integrations (support for Kubernetes, Podman, etc.)
* Documentation and tutorials for new users
* Testing and performance optimizations

##  Open Source Philosophy

LinuxStudio is designed with:

* **Loose coupling & modularity** – so features evolve independently.
* **Transparency** – showing users the Linux commands behind actions.
* **Accessibility** – works across devices and adheres to web standards.
* **Community-first** – built for real-world open-source collaboration.
